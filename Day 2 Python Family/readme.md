## Day 2 Python Family  
### Log:
1. Download python 3.5 in Anaconda and add to PATH

### Note:  
* Environment-Create-python35
* PATH: *mypath*\Anaconda3\envs\python35\Scripts (and without Scripts): adding both paths of python3.5 and pip
	
* Anaconda Prompt  
```
activate python35
pip install Jupyter
```
* pip is one of the Python package manager  
  * What we've done till now is downloading Anaconda (distribution containing the installation of Python and Jupyter and python is a prerequisite for installing jupyter) and creating an older version python environment with anaconda, then using anaconda prompt to activate older python and using pip to install Jupyter Notebook under older python  
  * The new version jupyter notebook is still there. To use jupyter notebook under python35, type jupyter notebook under python35 terminal
